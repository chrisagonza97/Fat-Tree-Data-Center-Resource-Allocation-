# Fat-Tree-Data-Center-Resource-Allocation-
Source code for testing and comparing different policy driven resource allocation algorithms
This fat tree source code was used to test different optimal and heuristic algorithms for ICCCN2020 paper: 
FT-VMP: Fault-Tolerant Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud Data Centers: http://csc.csudh.edu/btang/papers/icccn20_new.pdf
Comparing different Virtual Machine placement algorithms in a power efficient data center

There is also code to compare different traffic routing algorithms.

Minimum cost flow is computed using cs2, the second version of scaling algorithm for minimum-cost
flow problems. For more detailed description, see "An
Efficient Implementation of a Scaling Minimum-Cost Flow Algorithm" by
A.V. Goldberg, J. Algorithms, Vol. 22 (1997), pp. 1--29.
CS2 was developed by Andrew Goldberg (goldberg@intertrust.com) and
Boris Cherkassky (cher@cher.msk.su).
